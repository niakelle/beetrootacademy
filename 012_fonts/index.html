            his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About 
            twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered 
            the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with 
            its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched 
            along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
            bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a 
            particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a 
            torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
            <br><br>
            The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas 
            Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat,  
            and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of 
            the way.
            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge
            his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

            "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a 
            procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like 
            to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer 
            who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
